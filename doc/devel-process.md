# Bitcoin Core development process

## Introduction

The Bitcoin Core development process is the
[open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development)
development process.  Much of bitcoin's development process is
common to many of other open source projects.  Knowledge, lessons
and practices from other open source projects may also be applied
to bitcoin.

Trust is a critical component in a monetary system.  In a centralized
system, trust is normally invested in a central authority, such as the
US Federal Reserve and the US Treasury investing money and time to
prevent counterfeiting of US currency.

In bitcoin, trust in math and trust in the software replaces that
central authority.  The bitcoin software validates all data from the
beginning of bitcoin's history, through present day, to ensure that no
bitcoins have been double-spent and that all currency rules have been
followed.

By extension, then, you must trust the software being used to validate
the bitcoin data in the bitcoin blockchain and on the bitcoin network.
This trust in software is achieved through open source.

Licensed under the [MIT/X11 license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License),
the Bitcoin Core software is entirely open and available to inspection
by all.  Engineers who are able to read and study source code may
convince themselves that the software achieves a high level of security.
Trust in the software is earned through study, and observation in the
field over time.

However, the open source development process is often misunderstood.
Expectations may sometimes be misplaced.  It is the aim of this document
to explain how bitcoin software development works, and how organizations
and individuals may contribute to bitcoin development.
